*Notes*

This is my first automation test project related to web automation tests. I chose the technologies and languages provided below because they give flexibility about the type of tests that can be developed, and also the way tests can be configured (if needed they could be added to specific groups, have TestNg IRetryAnlyzer to perform retries when tests fail, be configured in test suite file, run in command line individually, by group, all together, etc).

This automation project exercise was developed in:
-Java
-Selenium
-TestNg
-Rest assured
-Maven
-Selenium Webdriver Manager
-Maven Surefire plugin
-Xpath

It has 2 test classes, for both User Story 1 and User Story 2.
For the User Story 1 - ReplaiWebpageTests
This class has 4 example tests that cover the assert of the homepage title, the assert of the pages on the dropdown menus, the assert of "Watch Video" section page, and the "FAQ" section page.
These tests were developed accordingly to the webpage structure. The decisions made about the path chosen for the specific elements were taken accordingly to the identifiers present on each page element.
Test related to dropdown menus has countdown launch waiters because the response time of the webdriver execution was too fast comparing to the response time of the webpage, and this was generating false negative test results.

For the User Story 2 - ReplaiCustomerTests
This class has 2 tests: 1 for the logo assertion, 1 for number of clients counting.
These tests were developed accordingly to the webpage structure and using the indicative present elements to identify the sections on the webpage.
The first test fails because the logo described in the User Story (YOUâ€™RE IN GOOD COMPANY) is not present on the page section that was referred (MEET THE GROWTH TEAMS POWERED BY REPLAI section).
The second test is counting the number of divs for each logo image that is present on the section.

It has "testng.xml" file that is the test suite, and also "index" webpage test report that is generated by TestNg.
